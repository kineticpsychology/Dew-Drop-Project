**TL;DR;**

Do what you want to do with the code. Once downloaded, it is your code. However, it is not exactly public domain. You can own, borrow, modify, distribute, commercialize the code with/without acknowledging the source. You can also choose to keep/remove the license text in each of the source files. However, you are NOT permitted to vandalize the code, or check in deliberate bad code. GitHub versioning will anyways take care of it.
